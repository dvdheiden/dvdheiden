# 👋 dvdheiden

Hi, I am @dvdheiden! Founder of my (former) personal business [Vdhicts](https://github.com/vdhicts) which has merged with the web agency [Goedemiddag](https://github.com/goedemiddag) at which I'm now a co-owner.

After studying Computer Science, I became a back-end PHP developer. Started using Laravel at version 3 and since Laravel 4.2, I decided to fully focus on using the Laravel framework to create websites and web applications. In 2022 I became a certified Laravel developer.

In addition to development, I frequently participate in project planning, process design and project management because I really like bridging the gap between technical execution and strategic decision-making to make sure the project offers genuine value and works well for both the client and the engineers.

## 📦 Packages

I enjoy developing open-source PHP packages, which allow me to experiment with new ideas or tools, contribute to the community, and create tools that makes (my own) development work a little bit easier. 

See the pinned repositories for my favorite packages, or take a look at my packages at:
- [@vdhicts](https://github.com/orgs/vdhicts/repositories)
- [@goedemiddag](https://github.com/orgs/goedemiddag/repositories)
