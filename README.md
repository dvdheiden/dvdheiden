# 👋 dvdheiden

Hi, I'm @dvdheiden, co-owner of the web agency [Goedemiddag](https://github.com/goedemiddag) and founder of my (former) personal company [Vdhicts](https://github.com/vdhicts).

As a back-end PHP developer, I specialize in building websites and web applications using the Laravel framework, for which I’m also a certified Laravel developer.

Besides development, I’m often involved in the planning, process design, and management of projects, taking on roles such as project manager or product owner. I enjoy bridging the gap between technical execution and strategic decision-making to ensure the project runs smoothly for both the developers and the client, and to ensure the project delivers real value.

## 📦 Packages

I enjoy developing open-source PHP packages, which allow me to experiment with new ideas or tools, contribute to the community, and create tools that makes (my own) development work a little bit easier. A quick look at some of the packages I've developed:
